### INFO

For more information on my process in developing this tool, check out my artstation post: https://www.artstation.com/caleb1duane2

### STARTUP
To use this plugin make sure both scripts are in your Maya scripts directory. Example path: C:\Users\Caleb\Documents\maya\2020\scripts
Please ensure both the launch script and the working script are in the same directory so they can communicate.

You then want to setup the launch script as a shelf tool. For help with this process checkout the link below.

Once you have the shelf and icon setup, if you attached the launch script to the icon correctly it will be as simple as clicking the button to get the tool working!
Thanks and happy May-uh-ing!
